        <h3>What are Databases?</h3>
      </div>
      <h4>A structured set of data</h4>
      <p>Databases are a collection of information, they are used for creating,
      manipulating and deleting data. There are many different types of databases
      and they can be classified in a basic approach of relational database or a
      non-relational database. Relationships mean a set of our data is related to
      another section of our data. Meanwhile in a non-relational database there is
      not a common related section of our data. Our databases are put into sections
      of data called schemas, inside each schema each data set is organized into
      tables, those tables contain columns and rows to house that particular set
      of data.</p>

        <h3>Storage</h3>

        <p>All databases are just a bin of storage. This storage is housed on your
        harddrive, often times large companies will have floors upon floors of just
        database storage (think NSA styled). Our computer stores information on the
        harddrive, we are able to create new information, read information, update
        information and delete information.</p>

        <p>Since there could potentially be a lot of information a database stores
        one problem we might run into is finding the data we are looking for. Imagine
        we had a room full of books and you were asked to find the Coding Dojo Algorithm
        Book. Well you might start picking up each book, checking the title and moving
        onto the next until you found it. Thats very slow as most libraries discovered.
        Instead if we were to ID each item we can find it quickly.</p>

        class="icon">
        <p>The amazing part about having a Database is that it is a storage bin that
          holds onto all saved data. Well if only one user had access to that data its
          just like what we have built into our own computers, it wouldnt be useful to
          other users. However the joy of having a database is that it is a storage bin
          many users can interact with, creating, reading, updating and deleting information
          that all users would see.</p>

        <p>There are a lot of large companies that specialize in the storing of
        information. As Big Data has erupted so too have the size and amount of
        companies on the market. That being said a lot of their software is free
        for most users, think of MySQL, which while being an incredible DB is
        completely free of cost and is used by a large company called Facebook.</p>
